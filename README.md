# The Pain Rituals Anthology
Welcome to The Pain Rituals Anthology website! This is a virtual collection of works dedicated to showing off the various ways pain is conceived and how pain is ritualized in various individuals. 

**## What Is A Pain Ritual?**
In this sense, pain is a personal experience that is influenced through various biological, psychological, generational, social, and cultural factors. For those who face the same pain repeatedly, whether they have a chronic pain condition, trauma, social challenges, and many other life conditions. Those who face pain repeatedly find ways to cope, mitigate, process, understand, live with, and eliminate the pain they are facing in ways this project is describing as "ritual". For the scope of this project, ritual is understood as traditions, practices, and habits that center pain as having value. This value could be negative value (such as processing the loss of a loved one) or positive value (such as continually attempting to defeat a boss in a digital game) depending on how pain is being understood.
